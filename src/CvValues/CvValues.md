# <a name="CvValues"></a>The CvValues Class #

The CvValues Class allows to read, modify and initialise the  Configuration Variables (CVs). CVs are stored in EEPROM, and keep their values after power down. The user sketch should call `cvValues.init()` as part of its `setup()` function. `cvValues.init()` checks if the EEPROM is still empty, or already filled with CV values. If the EEPROM is still empty, `cvValues.init()` will fill the EEPROM with  default values defined by this library. For different types of decoders this library provides different sets of default values. The user sketch may override these default values, if needed.

----
## Reading and writing CV values ##
The main sketch may read and modify the various CV values, and retrieve the decoders address.

#### uint8_t read(uint8_t number) ####
Returns the value of the specified CV number. See below for the list of the defined CV numbers. Read is not limited to the CVs in the list below, but may be used to read all EEPROM bytes.

#### void write(uint8_t number, uint8_t value) ####
Sets the specified CV number with the specified value. See below for the list of the defined CV numbers and the acceptable values. For a limited number of CVs a check is performed whether the provided value falls within the acceptable range.

#### unsigned int storedAddress(void) ####
Returns the decoder address, and is derived from CV1 and CV9.

## Configuration Variables ##

The following Configuration Variables are defined. The variables 1..32 are common for all decoders, the remaining variables are decoder specific.
The default values for the various CVs can be found in [CvValues.cpp](CvValues.cpp). Some of the newer decoders, such as the servo decoder, add additional CVs as part of the decoder specific code.

## EEPROM Initialisation ##

It turns out that the Arduino IDE may not reliably fill the EEPROM of a processor with initial values. Therefore it was decided to offer a `cvValues.init()` function, which must be called by the user in `setup()` of the main sketch. In turn `cvValues.init()` calls `setDefaults()`, to fill the empty EEPROM with default values, if needed. The `setDefaults()` function will also be called by the core functions after the onboard button is pushed for 5 seconds, or after CV8 is written. The user sketch need not call `setDefaults()` directly, however.

The type of decoder is not a compiler directive, but must be given as parameter to `cvValues.init()`. If the user wishes to override some of the default CV values, this can also be done within `setup()` by writing a new value to `cvValues.defaults[..]`.

![CvValues_initialisation](CvValues_initialisation.png "CvValues_initialisation")

#### void init(uint8_t decoderType, uint8_t softwareVersion = 10) ####
`Init()` *must* be called in `setup()` of the main sketch, to set the decoder type. As optional parameter the software version may be specified; if this parameter is omitted a default value of 10 is used. The decoder type is stored in CV27 and determines how the other CVs are interpreted. The following decoder types are defined:
````
SwitchDecoder                     = 0b00010000;   // Switch decoder
SwitchDecoderWithEmergency        = 0b00010001;   // Switch decoder with Emergency board
ServoDecoder                      = 0b00010100;   // Servo Decoder
LiftDecoder                       = 0b00011000;   // Lift Decoder
Relays4Decoder                    = 0b00100000;   // Relays decoder for 4 relays
Relays16Decoder                   = 0b00100001;   // Relays decoder for 16 relays
TrackOccupancyDecoder             = 0b00110000;   // Track Occupancy decoder
TrackOccupancyDecoderWithReverser = 0b00110001;   // Track Occupancy decoder with reverser
TrackOccupancyDecoderWithRelays   = 0b00110010;   // Track Occupancy decoder with relays
TrackOccupancyDecoderWithSpeed    = 0b00110100;   // Track Occupancy decoder with speed measurement
FunctionDecoder                   = 0b01000000;   // Function Decoder
SafetyDecoder                     = 0b10000000;   // Watchdog and safety decoder
````

#### bool addressNotSet(void) ####
Checks if the decoder address has been set or not. In case of track occupancy decoders (GBM: Gleis Besetz Melder) it checks if the RS-Bus address has been set or not.

#### bool isGBM(void) ####
Returns true if the decoder is a track occupancy decoders (GBM: Gleis Besetz Melder). CV27 (`DecType`) is used for this.

## Relation to RCN-225 ##

For CV1-CV30 we follow RCN-225, but with a number of exceptions:
 - CV2: not implemented here
 - CV10-16: These CVs are reserved by the NMRA, but are used here for RS-bus address and GBM delay
 - CV17-18: Should be "mirrored address", but used here for GBM delay
 - CV19-27: These CVs are reserved by the NMRA, but are used here for different purposes.
 - CV30:    This CV is reserved by the NMRA, but is used here for the second vendor ID.
 - CV31-32: Should be "pointers to extended area", but are used here for different purposes.

There are two reasons why we deviate from RCN-225. First, for CV11-Cv18 we decided to follow  the Lenz LR101 feedback decoder CVs. Second, we decided to use several of the other NMRA reserved CVs, since these have low CV numbers and are therefore stored at low EEPROM addresses.
The alternative would have been to use the vendor specific part (such as CV33-CV81), but such approach would have cost more EEPROM space.

----
## Address initialisation ##
If the decoder doesn't have a valid address, the onboard LED is slowly blinking. To initialise the decoder with a valid address, or to change the current address, push the onboard programming button shortly (like 1 second). The onboard LED now changes to fast blinking, to indicate that it expects an accessory (=switch) command to set the address. The next accessory (=switch) address received will now be used as the new address. For most decoders this new address should be a valid accessory address (thus in the range between 1 and 1024/2048), but for Occupancy Decoders this new address should be a valid RS-Bus address (thus in the range between 1 and 127; address 128 is already used for PoM feedback messages).

----
## Reset to default CV values ##
The reset the decoder to the default CV values, push the onboard programming button for 5 or more seconds. The default values will now be written to EPROM, and the decoder will restart. Reset also clears the decoder's address, so the onboard LED will now be blinking slowly to indicate that the decoder's address needs to be initialised.

The CV values can also be reset by writing (PoM or SM) 0x0D to CV8.
